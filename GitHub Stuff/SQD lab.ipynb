    "\n",
    "Finding the eigenvalues of large Hamiltonian matrices is a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics and a key application for quantum computers. While classical exact diagonalization becomes computationally intensive for even small-size molecules, subspace methods offer a powerful alternative. By projecting the Hamiltonian onto a smaller, carefully chosen subspace that captures the essential physics, we can solve the problem on a classical computer. The crucial question then becomes: how do we construct this \"useful\" subspace?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores and compares two distinct quantum approaches for constructing this subspace to find the ground state energy of the dinitrogen ($N_2$) molecules:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD): This is a sampling-based approach where a quantum circuit, or ansatz, is used to prepare a trial state. By measuring this state in the computational basis, we sample a set of important configurations that are then used to define the subspace. The quality of the prepared quantum state is critical for the SQD method. A well-designed ansatz that reflects the underlying chemistry of the problem can generate a much more effective subspace than a generic one. To demonstrate this, we will systematically compare the performance of three different ansatz strategies for SQD, observing how accuracy improves with a more informed approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) extends SQD by introducing a Krylov subspace. Instead of sampling from a trial state prepared by a general parameterized ansatz, SKQD begins with a reference state (in a chemistry problem, this is typically a Hartree-Fock state) and iteratively applies the Hamiltonian to generate a Krylov space, which is a powerful method for approximating the lowest eigenvalues of a matrix. The states sampled from this unitary Krylov space form a smaller, more effective subspace than those from a general parameterized ansatz and offer convergence guarantees.\n"

    "SQD is a powerful variational algorithm that builds a subspace by sampling from a trial wavefunction prepared by a parameterized quantum circuit, known as an ansatz. The general workflow of SQD is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Quantum Step: An ansatz circuit is executed on the quantum computer to prepare a trial state $|\\Psi(\\theta)\\rangle$. This state is measured in the computational basis many times to generate a collection of bitstrings (configurations).\n",
    "2.  Classical Step: A selection of the most significant configurations from the measurement results is used to form a basis for a small subspace. The full Hamiltonian is then projected onto this subspace and diagonalized classically to find its lowest eigenvalue. Instead of a complex manual classical post-processing loop, we will use the `diagonalize_fermionic_hamiltonian` function from the `qiskit-addon-sqd` package. This high-level function automatically handles the subspace construction, diagonalization, and optional self-consistent configuration recovery. This recovery process iteratively uses the solution from the previous diagonalization to sample new, more relevant configurations, thus refining the subspace and improving the final energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of SQD is highly dependent on the quality of the ansatz. A good ansatz should be able to represent the true ground state with high fidelity. In this chapter, we will investigate this dependency by running the SQD algorithm with three different ansatz strategies, from generic to highly informed.\n",

This type of ansatz is constructed using layers of single-qubit Y-rotations and CNOT gates, making it easy to implement on most quantum hardware. However, it lacks any specific chemical intuition. We will initialize quantum circuit by randomly selecting qubits with electrons and then initialize the parameters of this ansatz also randomly to establish a baseline performance for SQD when using a generic circuit without any prior chemical knowledge, except the number of active electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Circuit Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the `RealAmplitudes` ansatz from Qiskit's circuit library. Next, we build the full quantum circuit. We start with the `Hartree-Fock` state, then append the `RealAmplitudes` ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are initialized with random values between 0 and $2\\pi$. Finally, we add measurements to all qubits.\n",

    "    <h4>Congratulations! &#127881;</h4>\n",
    "    You have successfully calculated the ground state energy of the $N_2$ molecule using advanced quantum algorithms. You've seen firsthand how a diagonalization-based quantum approach, combining insights from classical chemistry with the power of quantum sampling, can achieve meaningful accuracy.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored two powerful quantum methods, SQD and SKQD, to determine the ground state energy of the $N_2$ molecule using different strategies. The results, summarized in the comparison plot below, clearly demonstrate the strengths and trade-offs of each approach, leading to a compelling conclusion: for quantum chemistry simulations on near-term devices, a physically-motivated ansatz initialized with classical chemical insight potentially provides an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation showed a systematic improvement in accuracy as we refined our SQD strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Baseline: The generic `RealAmplitudes` ansatz established a performance baseline. While it demonstrated convergence, its final error was the largest among all approaches, highlighting the limitations of a hardware-efficient but chemically unaware ansatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Improved Ansatz Structure: Switching to the chemistry-inspired `UCJ` ansatz, even with random parameters, yielded an improvement, converging to a result well within chemical accuracy. This demonstrates the power of choosing an ansatz structure that reflects the underlying physics of the problem \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The Informed Approach: Initializing the `UCJ` ansatz with t-amplitudes from a classical CCSD calculation also achieved a high degree of accuracy. This \"informed\" approach confirms that quantum algorithms can perform well when their state preparation is guided by classical approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Another Way of Good Sampling: Despite requiring deeper circuits, SKQD produced a result that also achieved chemical accuracy, and in this specific run, had the lowest final error. This showcases it as a powerful, non-variational alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, all chemistry-inspired methods (UCJ with random or informed parameters, and SKQD) far outperformed the generic ansatz. The small differences in final energy between them are likely within the statistical noise of the device and limitation of a simple basis-set, confirming that multiple pathways exist to achieve high accuracy in quantum chemistry simulations.\n",

    "- Overall Efficiency: The \"informed\" UCJ was the most accurate (but can differ by runs). Was it the most efficient overall? Consider the total computational cost, including the classical CCSD calculation time plus the quantum execution time. \n",
    "- SQD vs. SKQD: The SKQD circuit was noted to be very deep. Under what conditions might SKQD be a better choice than a variational method like SQD? \n",
    "- Problem Scaling: How would the resource requirements (qubits, circuit depth) and the impact of noise change if you were to simulate a slightly larger molecule, like water ($H_2O$), using the sto-6g basis set?\n",
    "- Subspace Insights: Beyond just the final energy, what can the sampled bitstrings tell you about the nature of the molecule's ground state? How does the distribution of the most frequent samples from the \"informed\" UCJ run differ from the RealAmplitudes run?\n",
